# Follow-up Questions

## 1. How long did you spend on the test?
Around 35 hours.

## 2. What would you add if you had more time?
I would implement a user controler so a customer logged in could have different bennefits for instance. I didn't implement any tests because I have no experience with it so if I had more time I would study and implement some tests.

## 3. How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume? 
I would format the values to currency format.

## 4. What did you find most difficult?
The most difficult part for me was to understand what exacly I needed to implement in order to complete the user stories.

## 5. How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?
After all I found it a great opportunity to learn with every single obstacle that I had to overcame during the development.
